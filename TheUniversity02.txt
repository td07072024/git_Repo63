The university has been envisioned as an international institution of national importance[38] and excellence.[39] It began its first academic session on 1 September 2014 with 15 students in the School of Historical Studies and the School of Ecology and Environmental studies. A hotel operated by Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation in Rajgir provided initial hostel accommodation.[40][41] Initially set up with temporary facilities in Rajgir, a modern campus spanning over 160 hectares (400 acres) is under construction with over 80 percent having been completed by 2021.[37][42] The university started functioning from its 455-acres new campus from January 2020.[43] At least 200 villages surrounding the university will be attached to the university, reminiscent of the old Nalanda.[44]

Nalanda University becomes the first plastic free campus of Bihar.[45] Water in the university is now being available in glass bottles instead of plastic bottles. Along with this, biogas will also be produced.[citation needed]

For the academic year 2022-23, the University had 822 students in total. For the academic year 2023-24, the University had admitted 1038 students, out of which a total of 187 are international students (including Masters, Global PhD & Short Programmes as per January cycle).[46]
